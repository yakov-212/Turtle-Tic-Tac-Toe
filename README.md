It wasnt a good tutorial. He left out a lot of important stuff like the entire onclick function and making a player dict for the positions. 
To be honest if I didnt see the first three lines of code of the onclick function which i was lucky enough to spot at 2:07-2:11 then I would'nt have been able to make this game.
Well maybe i could but it would look a lot diffrent.
I Wouldnt have known about the //, I do remember using them in the space shooter game tho.
